# Recipe Recommender - Simple Food Matcher

## Project Overview
The Recipe Recommender project is a simple web application designed to recommend recipes based on the ingredients available to the user. It allows users to input available ingredients, and then fetches recipe suggestions using the OpenAI API. The results are displayed as clickable recipe cards, making it easy for users to browse through suggested recipes.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: 
  - HTML5/CSS (Recipe Cards)
  - JavaScript (Ingredient filtering)
- **Backend**: 
  - Python (Flask for handling requests)
  - MySQL (Database for storing recipes and user information)
- **AI**: 
  - OpenAI API (Free Tier for generating text-based recipe suggestions)

## How it Works
1. The user selects available ingredients (e.g., "chicken, tomatoes").
2. The Python backend sends a query to the OpenAI API: *"Suggest 3 simple recipes with [ingredients]"*.
3. The API returns the suggested recipes, which are then saved to a MySQL database.
4. The recipes are displayed as clickable recipe cards on the frontend, providing an easy way for users to interact with the results.

## Features
- **Ingredient-based Recipe Suggestions**: Users can input ingredients they already have, and the app provides recipe ideas based on those ingredients.
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: The app uses the OpenAI API to generate recipe suggestions, making it more dynamic and adaptable to different ingredient combinations.
- **Database Integration**: MySQL is used to store user data and recipe suggestions, allowing for easy retrieval and display of data.
- **Simple User Interface**: The frontend uses HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to display recipe cards and allow for ingredient filtering.

## Beginner Perks
- Uses **basic SQL joins** to link users with their respective recipes.
- No image processingâ€”pure text interaction, making the project easy to implement and understand.
- Demonstrates practical **API integration** (OpenAI API) in a real-world scenario, which is valuable for learning and hands-on experience.
